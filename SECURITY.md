# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The MaverickMCP team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via GitHub Security Advisories (recommended).

Please include:
- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of affected source files
- Location of the affected code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Security Features

MaverickMCP implements security measures appropriate for personal-use software:

### Personal Use Security Model
- **Local Deployment**: Designed to run locally for individual users
- **No Network Authentication**: Simplicity over complex auth systems
- **Environment Variable Security**: All API keys stored as environment variables
- **Basic Rate Limiting**: Protection against excessive API calls

### Data Protection
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive Pydantic validation on all inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: SQLAlchemy ORM with parameterized queries
- **API Key Security**: Secure handling of financial data provider credentials
- **Local Data Storage**: All analysis data stored locally by default

### Infrastructure Security
- **Environment Variables**: All secrets externalized, no hardcoded credentials
- **Secure Headers**: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
- **Circuit Breakers**: Protection against cascade failures

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Configuration
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Follow the `.env.example` template
- Use strong, unique passwords for development databases

### Code Guidelines
- Always validate and sanitize user input
- Use parameterized queries (SQLAlchemy ORM)
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Add rate limiting to new endpoints

### Dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review security advisories regularly
- Run `safety check` before releases
- Use `bandit` for static security analysis

## Running Security Audits

### Dependency Scanning
```bash
# Install security tools
pip install safety bandit

# Check for known vulnerabilities
safety check

# Static security analysis
bandit -r maverick_mcp/
```

### Additional Security Tools
```bash
# OWASP dependency check
pip install pip-audit
pip-audit

# Advanced static analysis
pip install semgrep
semgrep --config=auto maverick_mcp/
```

## Security Headers Configuration

The application implements the following security headers:
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'`

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**: Assess the severity and impact
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
3. **Investigation**: Determine root cause and extent
4. **Remediation**: Fix the vulnerability
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Post-Incident**: Document lessons learned

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the following individuals for responsibly disclosing security issues:

*This list will be updated as vulnerabilities are reported and fixed.*

## Financial Data Security

### Investment Data Protection
- **Personal Investment Information**: Never share account details, positions, or personal financial data
- **API Keys**: Secure storage of financial data provider API keys (Tiingo, FRED, etc.)
- **Market Data**: Ensure compliance with data provider terms of service and usage restrictions
- **Analysis Results**: Be aware that financial analysis outputs may contain sensitive investment insights

### Compliance Considerations
- **Financial Regulations**: Users must comply with applicable securities laws (SEC, CFTC, etc.)
- **Data Privacy**: Market analysis and portfolio data should be treated as confidential
- **Audit Trails**: Financial analysis activities may need to be logged for regulatory purposes
- **Cross-border Data**: Consider regulations when using financial data across international boundaries
