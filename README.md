## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+**: Core runtime environment
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)**: Modern Python package manager (recommended)
- **TA-Lib**: Technical analysis library for advanced indicators
- Redis (optional, for enhanced caching)
- PostgreSQL or SQLite (optional, for data persistence)

#### Installing TA-Lib

TA-Lib is required for technical analysis calculations.

**macOS and Linux (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install ta-lib
```

**Windows (Multiple Options):**

**Option 1: Conda/Anaconda (Recommended - Easiest)**
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge ta-lib
```

**Option 2: Pre-compiled Wheels**
1. Download the appropriate wheel for your Python version from:
   - [cgohlke/talib-build releases](https://github.com/cgohlke/talib-build/releases)
   - Choose the file matching your Python version (e.g., `TA_Lib-0.4.28-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl` for Python 3.12 64-bit)
2. Install using pip:
```bash
pip install path/to/downloaded/TA_Lib-X.X.X-cpXXX-cpXXX-win_amd64.whl
```

**Option 3: Alternative Pre-compiled Package**
```bash
pip install TA-Lib-Precompiled
```

**Option 4: Build from Source (Advanced)**
If other methods fail, you can build from source:
1. Install Microsoft C++ Build Tools
2. Download and extract ta-lib C library to `C:\ta-lib`
3. Build using Visual Studio tools
4. Run `pip install ta-lib`

**Verification:**
Test your installation:
```bash
python -c "import talib; print(talib.__version__)"
```

#### Installing uv (Recommended)

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Alternative: via pip
pip install uv
```

### Installation

#### Option 1: Using uv (Recommended - Fastest)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wshobson/maverick-mcp.git
cd maverick-mcp

# Install dependencies and create virtual environment in one command
uv sync

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env
# Add your Tiingo API key (free at tiingo.com)
```

#### Option 2: Using pip (Traditional)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wshobson/maverick-mcp.git
cd maverick-mcp

# Create virtual environment and install
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env
# Add your Tiingo API key (free at tiingo.com)
```

### Start the Server

```bash
# One command to start everything (includes S&P 500 data seeding on first run)
make dev

# The server is now running with:
# - HTTP endpoint: http://localhost:8003/mcp/
# - SSE endpoint: http://localhost:8003/sse/
# - 520 S&P 500 stocks pre-loaded with screening data
```

### Connect to Claude Desktop

**Recommended: SSE Connection (Stable and Reliable)**

This configuration provides stable tool registration and prevents tools from disappearing:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "maverick-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8003/sse/"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Important**: Note the trailing slash in `/sse/` - this is REQUIRED to prevent redirect issues!

**Config File Location:**
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Why This Configuration Works Best:**
- Stable tool registration - tools don't disappear after initial connection
- Reliable connection management through SSE transport
- Proper session persistence for long-running analysis tasks
- All 29+ financial tools available consistently

**Alternative: Direct STDIO Connection (Development Only)**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "maverick-mcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "python",
        "-m",
        "maverick_mcp.api.server",
        "--transport",
        "stdio"
      ],
      "cwd": "/path/to/maverick-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Important**: Always **restart Claude Desktop** after making configuration changes. The SSE configuration via mcp-remote has been tested and confirmed to provide stable, persistent tool access without connection drops.

That's it! MaverickMCP tools will now be available in your Claude Desktop interface.

#### Claude Desktop (Most Popular) - Recommended Configuration

**Config Location**:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

#### Cursor IDE - STDIO and SSE

**Option 1: STDIO (via mcp-remote)**:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "maverick-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8003/sse/"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Option 2: Direct SSE**:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "maverick-mcp": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8003/sse/"
    }
  }
}
```

**Config Location**: Cursor → Settings → MCP Servers

#### Claude Code CLI - All Transports

**HTTP Transport (Recommended)**:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http maverick-mcp http://localhost:8003/mcp/
```

**SSE Transport (Alternative)**:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport sse maverick-mcp http://localhost:8003/sse/
```

**STDIO Transport (Development)**:

```bash
claude mcp add maverick-mcp uv run python -m maverick_mcp.api.server --transport stdio
```

#### Windsurf IDE - STDIO and SSE

**Option 1: STDIO (via mcp-remote)**:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "maverick-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8003/mcp/"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Option 2: Direct SSE**:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "maverick-mcp": {
      "serverUrl": "http://localhost:8003/sse/"
    }
  }
}
```

**Config Location**: Windsurf → Settings → Advanced Settings → MCP Servers

#### Why mcp-remote is Needed

The `mcp-remote` tool bridges the gap between STDIO-only clients (like Claude Desktop) and HTTP/SSE servers. Without it, these clients cannot connect to remote MCP servers:

- **Without mcp-remote**: Client tries STDIO → Server expects HTTP → Connection fails
- **With mcp-remote**: Client uses STDIO → mcp-remote converts to HTTP → Server receives HTTP → Success

## Docker (Optional)

For containerized deployment:

cp .env.example .env

# Using uv in Docker (recommended for faster builds)
docker build -t maverick_mcp .
docker run -p 8003:8003 --env-file .env maverick_mcp

# Or start with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d
```

**Note**: The Dockerfile uses `uv` for fast dependency installation and smaller image sizes.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tools Disappearing in Claude Desktop:**
- **Solution**: Ensure SSE endpoint has trailing slash: `http://localhost:8003/sse/`
- The 307 redirect from `/sse` to `/sse/` causes tool registration to fail
- Always use the exact configuration with trailing slash shown above

**Research Tool Timeouts:**
- Research tools have adaptive timeouts (120s-600s)
- Deep research may take 2-10 minutes depending on complexity
- Monitor progress in server logs with `make tail-log`

**OpenRouter Not Working:**
- Ensure `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
- Check API key validity at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
- System falls back to direct providers if OpenRouter unavailable

```bash
# Common development issues
make tail-log          # View server logs
make stop              # Stop services if ports are in use
make clean             # Clean up cache files

# Quick fixes:
# Port 8003 in use → make stop
# Redis connection refused → brew services start redis
# Tests failing → make test (unit tests only)
# Slow startup → ./tools/fast_dev.sh
# Missing S&P 500 data → uv run python scripts/seed_sp500.py
# Research timeouts → Check logs, increase timeout settings
```

## Extending MaverickMCP

Add custom financial analysis tools with simple decorators:

```python
@mcp.tool()
def my_custom_indicator(ticker: str, period: int = 14):
    """Calculate custom technical indicator."""
    # Your analysis logic here
    return {"ticker": ticker, "signal": "buy", "confidence": 0.85}

@mcp.resource("custom://analysis/{ticker}")
def custom_analysis(ticker: str):
    """Custom analysis resource."""
    # Your resource logic here
    return f"Custom analysis for {ticker}"
```

## Development Tools

### Quick Development Workflow

```bash
make dev               # Start everything
make stop              # Stop services
make tail-log          # Follow server logs
make test              # Run tests quickly
make experiment        # Test custom analysis scripts
```
