## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Implemented

### 1. RBI Data Provider (`maverick_mcp/providers/rbi_data.py`)

- Policy rates (Repo, Reverse Repo, CRR, SLR)
- GDP growth data via World Bank API
- Foreign exchange reserves
- Economic calendar with upcoming events
- Inflation data (CPI/WPI)
- Comprehensive `get_all_indicators()` method
- 1-hour TTL caching for performance

### 2. Indian News Provider (`maverick_mcp/providers/indian_news.py`)

- Multi-source news aggregation (MoneyControl, Economic Times, LiveMint, Business Standard)
- Stock-specific news fetching
- Market-wide news by category
- Sentiment analysis (bullish/bearish/neutral)
- Trending topics identification
- Basic implementation ready for API integration

### 3. Market Comparison Analyzer (`maverick_mcp/analysis/market_comparison.py`)

- Index comparison (S&P 500 vs Nifty 50)
- Stock-to-stock comparison across markets
- Correlation analysis
- Currency-adjusted returns
- Volatility comparison
- Performance metrics

### 4. Currency Converter (`maverick_mcp/utils/currency_converter.py`)

- INR/USD bidirectional conversion
- Approximate exchange rate (~83 INR = 1 USD)
- Historical rates support (placeholder)
- Time series conversion
- Ready for real-time API integration

### 5. MCP Tools Integration (`maverick_mcp/api/server.py`)

Added 5 new Claude Desktop tools:

- `get_indian_economic_indicators()` - All RBI indicators at once
- `get_indian_stock_news(symbol, limit)` - News with sentiment
- `compare_us_indian_markets(period)` - Index comparison
- `convert_currency(amount, from, to)` - INR/USD conversion
- `compare_similar_companies(us_symbol, indian_symbol, currency)` - Cross-market stock comparison

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test Suite (`tests/test_phase4_features.py`)

Created comprehensive tests covering:

- Currency converter initialization and conversion logic
- Market comparison analyzer functionality
- Indian news provider operations
- RBI data provider methods
- Integration tests for cross-provider functionality

### Validation Results

âœ… All components tested successfully
âœ… Currency conversion working (USD â†” INR)
âœ… News provider returning placeholder data with sentiment
âœ… Market comparison analyzer initialized correctly
âœ… RBI data provider fetching policy rates and indicators
âœ… Cross-provider integration verified
